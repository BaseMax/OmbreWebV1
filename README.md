## What is Ombre?

Ombre is a cryptonote currency and an indirect for of the well-known Monero currency. Inherited from Monero are strong security, privacy and untraceability features that form a solid basis for further development. Our mission is to enhance the cryptonote protocol to provide a lightweight, secure, well maintained and actively developed (no-nonsense) coin.
